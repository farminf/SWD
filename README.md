The Android Application which is working mainly with BlueTooth, when the app is coming up, it discovers for other BT devices.
It compares all device names with the one that we are giving to app and if it was True, It starts to connect with the device 
in insecure way.(They are not sending any Pin)
First time which it discovers the device, it makes a file on SD including the exact time of discovery.
And first when we connected to device, It automatically sends that file to device.
Also there is a Button which we can send that file manually.
There is a "run in Background" button.
In Menu, We can insert the name of the device which we want to connect.
Also there is an activity for showing paired devices.The app has a button for that.
